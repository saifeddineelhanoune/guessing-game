<h1>#Guessing_Game</h1>

<ol type = "1">
    <h3>basic implementation of a guessing game in Rust. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is incorrect, the program tells them whether their guess was too big or too small. If the user's guess is correct, the program prints a message saying "You Win" and exits the loop.<h3>
    <p>Here are a few things you could do to improve this code:</p>
    <li>Add error handling for the case where the user does not enter a valid number. You can use the Result type and the .expect() method to handle any errors that occur when parsing the user's input.</li>
    <li>Add a limit to the number of guesses the user is allowed to make. You can do this by using a counter variable that increments each time the user makes a guess, and exiting the loop when the counter reaches a certain value<li>
    <li>Add some visual feedback to the game by using ASCII art or other graphics to make it more visually appealing.</li>
    <li>Add some additional features to the game, such as a hint system that gives the user a hint if they are struggling to guess the correct number.</li>

<p>With just taping the random number wrtied on the screen you'll win it's just an concept of learning</p>
